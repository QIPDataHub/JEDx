This a github repository for the JEDx Stage II Pilot. Code for various parts of the project will be placed here so the whole repository may not be of interest to you.

Please create a new branch for each section of the repository you are working on. For example, if I am working just the schema section I will make a branch just for working in the schema section. That way we don't have to do complicated merges among the various contributors. Thanks.

| Client of Vendor-Worker Organization            | A Vendor-Worker Organization (VWO) is a firm that supplies workers to client organizations while retaining status as the employer of record. These firms manage core employment responsibilities such as payroll, tax withholding, benefits administration, and compliance with labor regulations. Although the provider remains the legal employer, the client organization typically directs the workers’ day-to-day tasks and job performance. Common examples include professional employer organizations (PEOs), staffing agencies, and employee leasing companies. This arrangement allows client organizations to access labor and workforce flexibility without taking on the full legal and administrative obligations of direct employment. | I.N                         | To be determined      |                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Mapping to be determined                                                                                                                        |

SVP measures the minimum vocational preparation time needed for a job.  SVP includes only vocationally relevant preparation time. Therefore, SVP excludes time spent completing general education requirements, non-vocationally relevant credentials, general experience, and probationary periods where workers aren’t actively receiving on the job training. Exclude any establishment hiring requirements that do not relate to the job’s critical tasks.

| Occupational Classification Information (repeating) | Occupation - An occupation is a broad term representing a defined set of responsibilities, skills, and tasks common across establishments rather than specific to a job in an individual company. Occupational classification uses numeric coding structures to classify a job's essential work activities/functions/tasks so it can be compared across employers and industries. Claaification codes are assigned by employers, employment services orgnanizations, and statistical agencies to classify work performed into categories for collecting, calculating, comparing  data about the types of work performed and and compensation offered.                                                                                     | IV.G                        | Workers/                                 |                                    | A Standard Occupational Classification Codes classifies a job's essential work activities/functions/tasks.

It is a written plan that allows employees to choose between receiving cash or taxable benefits, instead of certain qualified benefits for which the law provides an exclusion from wages. If an employee chooses to receive a qualified benefit under the plan, the fact that the employee could have received cash, or a taxable benefit instead won't make the qualified benefit taxable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             | DirectCompensation/                                      | DirectCompensation/                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                    |

It is a written plan that allows employees to choose between receiving cash or taxable benefits, instead of certain qualified benefits for which the law provides an exclusion from wages. If an employee chooses to receive a qualified benefit under the plan, the fact that the employee could have received cash, or a taxable benefit instead won't make the qualified benefit taxable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             |                                                          |                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                    |

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97) removed qualified bicycle commuting reimbursements as de minimis for the tax years 2018 through 2025.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                             |                                                          |                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                    |

A bona fide reimbursement arrangement requires that the employee incur and substantiate expenses for qualified transportation benefits before reimbursement. However, cash reimbursements for transit passes qualify only if a voucher or a similar item that the employee can exchange only for a transit pass isn't readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee. A voucher is readily available for direct distribution only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher provider that doesn't impose fare media charges or other restrictions that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers.                                                                                                                   |                             |                                                          |                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                    |
