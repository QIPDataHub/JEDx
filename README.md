This a github repository for the JEDx Stage II Pilot. Code for various parts of the project will be placed here so the whole repository may not be of interest to you.

Please create a new branch for each section of the repository you are working on. For example, if I am working just the schema section I will make a branch just for working in the schema section. That way we don't have to do complicated merges among the various contributors. Thanks.
