This folder contains **synthetic sample data files** used in the Stage 2 demonstration of the JEDx Phase II Pilot. The files were created to simulate how data flow through the system when using the **JEDx CAR service** to send files and the **JEDx Collector service** to receive them.  

The data here are entirely synthetic and intended solely for **demonstration purposes**. These data files allow project participants to test workflows, validate schema handling, and illustrate the sender/receiver interaction without using real-world or sensitive data.  

Files are organized into three subfolders to reflect different data sets used during the demo. Each subfolder corresponds to a scenario that was exercised to showcase the end-to-end data pipeline.
